//Model the Rabbit class knowing that:

//a rabbit can have Blue, Red or Black eyes
//a rabbit's fur can be white, brown, black or grey
//it has a gender
//has a birth date, and based on that you should be able to see how
//old the rabbit is
//we also know that a rabbit is a mammal that moves, sleeps and eats certain foods
